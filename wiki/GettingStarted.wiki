= Hello Tweepy =
Let's start of with a very basic _hello world_ example.

{{{
import tweepy

public_tweets = tweepy.api.public_timeline()
for tweet in public_tweets:
    print tweet.text
}}}

This example will download the public timeline tweets and print each one of their texts to the console. `tweepy.api` in the above code snippet is an unauthenticated instance of the tweepy API class. The API class contains all the methods for access the Twitter API. By unauthenticated means there is no user associated with this instance. So you may only do unauthenticated API calls with this instance. For example the following would fail:

{{{
tweepy.api.update_status('will not work!')
}}}

The AuthTutorial goes into more details about authentication.
